  # Here's a sample of a line we need to parse
  # $1750 / 1br - 650ftÂ² -
  # We can use a regular expression to find the price given the line above
  # One thing to note: when we run the match method on the description it will return
  # a MatchData object, like so:
  #  <MatchData "$1750" 1:"1750">
  # We'll need to access the "1750" the same way we access arrays
  # If you're totally confused it's worth referencing a guide on regular expressions
  # http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/ruby-for-newbies-regular-expressions/

  # The following block of code checks to see if the string 'description'
  # contains a price
  if description.match(/\$(\d+)/)
    # if the description contains a price, assign it to the variable price
    price = description.match(/\$(\d+)/)
    # because we're using the match method we're dealing with a MatchData object
    # we can pull the price out of it by calling price[1]
    return price[1]
  else
    # if the regular expression can't find a price it will return 'nil'
    # this can cause the script to break, so we're setting a price of $0
    # for apartment listings that don't contain one
    return 0
